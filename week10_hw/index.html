                        Europe is the most represented continent in the five leagues, which is hardly surprising since
                        these leagues are based in Europe. Africa and South America are also very well represented in
                        the
                        five leagues, with Africa boasting Premier League household names Mohamed Salah and
                        Sadio Mane, while
                        South America is home to superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar.

                        <i>Expected Goals (xG)</i> measures the likelihood that a player scores from a particular
                        situation
                        during a game. The value of <i>xG</i> ranges from zero to one, where zero represents a chance
                        which is
                        impossible to score.
                        Conversely, a value of one means that a player is expected to score every single time. By
                        analysing the <i>xG</i> and goals scored for a player,
                        we can understand the shooting ability of luck of a particular player. A player who consistently
                        scores more goals than their total <i>xG</i>
                        probably has an above average shooting/finishing ability. Conversely, a player who has fewer
                        goals scored
                        compared to their total <i>xG</i> may be more wasteful in front goal, or simply subject to poor
                        luck. During the 2021/2022
                        season, <span class="overperformed_xg">Wissam Ben Yedder</span>, <span
                            class="overperformed_xg">Son Heung Min</span> and <span class="overperformed_xg">Martin
                            Terrier</span> were 20-goal players who significantly outperformed their total <i>xG</i>,
                        while <span class="underperformed_xg">Burak Yılmaz</span> and <span
                            class="underperformed_xg">Iñaki Williams</span> were the two most underperforming players
                        based on the conversion of <i>xG</i>.
