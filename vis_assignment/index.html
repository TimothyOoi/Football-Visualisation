                        football leagues not only in Europe, but also the world.

                        &emsp;Europe is the most represented continent in the five leagues, which is
                        hardly surprising
                        since
                        these leagues are based in Europe. With <strong>436</strong> players, <strong>Spain</strong> is
                        the leading nation in the world.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp;Africa and South America are also very well represented
                        in
                        the five leagues, with <strong>Senegal</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> the leading nation

                        &emsp;<i>Expected Goals (xG)</i> measures the likelihood that a player scores from a particular

                        during a game. A player who scores more goals than their total <i>xG</i> is overperforming in
                        front of goal, whereas
                        a player underperformed if their goals scored is lower than their <i>xG</i>.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;During the 2021/2022 season, the most frequent player age group among the five leagues is
                        the <strong>24
                            to
                            26</strong> age group.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp;However, this is not the case for all leagues. For both <span

                        <span class="ligue-one">Ligue 1</span>, the
                        younger <strong>21 to 23</strong> age group is the most frequent age group. As for <span

                    <p>
                        &emsp;Considering players who played 20 games and above, the median passes attempted per player
                        was the highest in <span class="ligue-one">Ligue 1</span>. <strong>Marco Verrati</strong>
                        attempted
                        and completed the most passes per 90 minutes. <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> completed the most
                        progressive passes per 90 minutes, which suggests that he was among the best players in moving
                        his team forward with his ball distribution.

                    <h2>Ball Playing Goalkeepers</h2>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;Gone are the days where goalkeepers only stopped shots. In the 2021/2022 season, numbers
                        show that
                        first choice goalkeepers from <strong>higher ranked</strong> teams have a <strong>higher clean
                            sheet
                            rate</strong>, but they also
                        performed <strong>passes at shorter distances</strong> on average.
                        <br><br>
                        &emsp;Unsurprisingly, a higher clean sheet rate translates to fewer goals conceded per 90
                        minutes in general.
